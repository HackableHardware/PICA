Power, Interface, and Control Adapter

An Arduino Mega shield for reprap machines

Based in part on RAMPS by Johnny Russell

Power

* 5x20mm replaceable fuse input 

* 12V to 24V input with on-board 12V buck converter for systems with both 24V and 12V devices

* Five separate MOSFET outputs:

1 High power (15A, up to 24V)
2 Medium power (6A, up to 24V)
2 Low power (2A, 12V)

* Plus 1 SSR output (SPST) capable of 240VAC/5A (more with heatsink)

Monitoring 

* four thermistor inputs
* six endstop inputs

Interface

* LCD interface (SMART LCD controller pinout)
* I2C, 2xSerial, 3xPWM, and auxiliary DC power output connections
* Five Pololu stepper motor driver sockets (A4988 or DRV8825)
